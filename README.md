Bicycle Transmission Library
============================

These are me bachelor thesis source files. The goal of this project is to create a library and a firmware for an [arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) automated bycicle transmission.

How to use it
-------------

Still have to write this.

Contributing
------------

In the current stage I'm not open to external contribution, mainly because now my goal is to customize it to my test scenario (and obtain my bachelor :) ). After I finished my thesisI'll be able to check your contibution. But if in the meantime you want to use the sources, please, do it.
